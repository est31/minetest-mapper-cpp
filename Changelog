[20 feb 2015]
    Features:
	- A custom major and minor division can now be specified for the scale.
	- When the major scale division is divisible by 16, block numbers are
	  also included on the scale
	- Instead of a regular map, a height map can now be generated as well.
		- It can be generated in shades of a single color, or in multiple colors.
		- For multiple colors, a height-map colors file is needed. Two sample
		  versions are included: a file which produces nice maps on standard
		  minetest worlds (mapgen v6), while still covering a reasonably large
		  range of heights for other worlds, and a rainbow colors file.
		- A nodes file is also needed, which specifies which nodes should be
		  considered (and hence, which ones should be ignored) when determining
		  the height of a region of the world. A nodes file is included.
		- Optionally, a height scale can be drawn at the bottom of the map.
	- The map can now be generated in a reduced size. This means that it is finally
		possible to generate a full map of a maximal world, albeit at a lower
		resolution
		(at most 1:2 on 64-bit systems and 1:4 on 32-bit systems). Overview maps
		at 1:16 are another use of this feature.
		The following scale factors are supported: 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8 and 1:16.

		Note that this version of minetestmapper also supports generating a
		huge map in sections, and pasting them together with an external program.
		See below.

    Enhancements:
	- The left scale was widened, as it didn't accomodate 5-digit coordinates
	- The --tiles option gained the shorthand values 'block' and 'chunk', which
		align the tiles with minetest's block and chunk boundaries.
		The default chunk size is obtained from the world's data files.
		An option --chunksize was also added to override the default chunk size.
	- For a stack of only transparent nodes, the topmost height is now used.
		(instead of the bottom-most height)
	- The progress indicator was improved
	- Ice was made slightly transparent in the included colors file
	- A small number of symbolic colors are now recognised. In addition, they
		can be modified by mixing in several basic colors (e.g. white to make
		the color lighter, or black to make it darker)
	- It is now possible to draw a scale on just the left or the top side. This
		means that it is possible to generate a map in independent sections, which
		can be assembled into a large map later (using another application).
	- The documentation was improved. A separate user manual and a build manual
		are now included.

    Bugfixes:
	- Fixed incorrect shading near 'holes' in the world map.
	- Fixed wrong color for default:water_source in colors.txt
	- Parts of the scale are no longer written into the top-left corner of the map,
		where they would sometimes clobber the axis names or each other.
	(Some other bugs were fixed as a side-effect of the new features and enhancements.
	 Unfortunately, no good record exists...)

[20 jun 2014]
    Features:
	- Added the ability to select a method of transparency computation for
		drawalpha. Three methods are supported when transparency is enabled:
		- cumulative: The original mode. Colors become slightly darker and
		  more opaque as the number of stacked transparent blocks increases
		- cumulative-darken: Same as cumulative, except that when the color
		  has become opaque, the color is progressively darkened to visually
		  simulate greater depth. Eventually, this will cause the color to
		  become black.
		  This used to be the default and only method since commit 8faa2d
		  (on 10 april 2014)
		- average: Transparent blocks always remain transparent, regardless
		  of their stacking height. This means that the bottom of deep oceans,
		  and any artefacts that exist there remains visible. When different
		  types of transparent blocks sit on top of each other, their average
		  color and transparency is used.
		  This method is now the default.

    Enhancements:
	- The default lava color has been changed to slightly transparent.
	- The default water color has been made slightly lighter.
	- Alternative color definitions are provided for different methods of
		transparency computation

    Bugfixes:
	- Minetestmapper should now build correctly on clang/freebsd

[18 jun 2014]
    Features:
	- The package generation code for Linux was extensively reworked and
		extended.
		Besides two types of .tar.gz packages, .deb and .rpm packages
		can now be generated as well. In addition, make install now
		installs packages in an appropriate directory hierarchy.

		The rpm package has an installation glitch: it tries to create
		a directory which already exists (system default), causing an
		installation conflict. This is harmless, but the rpm package must
		therefore be installed with --replacefiles.

		Package generation on OSX and Windows platforms remains unchanged.
	- 'Air' nodes can now have a color. Their color should be defined as fully
		transparent (alpha = 0), so that they don't obscure underlying blocks.
		With alpha = 0, air will only be drawn if no other blocks are beneath it.
		As it comes at a significant performance penalty, this feature is
		subject to a command-line option: --drawair.

		Full transparency is supported for other blocks as well, enabled by
		setting their alpha value to 0.  Nodes with alpha value 0 never
		participate in shading.
	- A default color can be specified for invisible/undefined nodes in rendered
		blocks. Normally, such nodes are not drawn, so they have the background
		color; If a different default color is specified, undefined/invisible
		nodes in defined blocks get the default color, and can be distinguished
		from undefined blocks (which still have the regular background color).

		This option is really only useful to get a better idea of what is
		actually in the database.
	- A color file can now include other color files. It is therefore no longer
		necessary to create an entirely new copy to be able to change one
		or two colors. Instead, an empty file can be created. In that file,
		the master copy is simply referred to ('@include <master>'), and then
		just the desired differences are added to it.
		It is not only possible to override colors in the new file, but
		colors can also be undefined if necessary.
	- Freeminer maps are now supported (and tested).
		In particular, this means that the new key format used in the leveldb
		database (a<x>,<y>,<z>) is now supported.

		Please note that freeminer maps will probably contain a lot of holes and
		other 'unrendered' areas (e.g. missing plains, making the grey rocks
		beneath visible; missing water, showing only the bottom of the lake/sea,
		etc.
		This is caused by the fact the freeminer does not store unchanged blocks
		in the database, but prefers to regenerate them later. As minetestmapper
		can only render what's in the database, this causes the holes etc.

    Enhancements:
	- Minetestmapper now has a version number (which is (partially) computed).
	- A system-wide colors.txt file is now supported as well. Its location is
		hardcoded at compile-time.
	- Redis support is now fully tested.
	- A command-line option to report which colors file(s) are read was added.

    Bugfixes:
	- Fixed the bug which caused compilation to fail if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE was not
		configured.
	- Computation of transparency for nodes was improved / fixed
	- The return value of a redis database operation was not correctly
		checked. This was fixed.

[22 may 2014]
    General: integrated all (relevant) patches from the minetest/minetestmapper tree
	(only patches that actually conflict with my work were obviously not merged)

    Features:
	- redis backend support (merged from minetest/minetestmapper)
		The code was ported and compiles. Unfortunately, I wasn't able
		to test against a redis database yet.
	- The database backend to use is now obtained from the world.mt file by default
	- Additional geometrical figures can be drawn on the map
		Similar to the circles drawn for origin and players. Supported figures
		are: point, line, rectangle, ellipse (circle), text.
		Translucency (alpha) is supported, although for ellipses, it does not
		work as expected (due to a bug in libgd)

    Enhancements:
	- Failure to process a command-line option now causes a specific error message.
		The generic help message is often not very helpful in such a case.
	- The map origin color and Player colors can now be specified with an alpha value.
		Unfortunately, due to a bug in libgd, the effect is not what it should be...
	- The colors.txt file is now also searched for in the world's minetest directory
		(the directory containing minetest.conf) - if it can be found.
	- C++11 compilation is enabled if supported. If so, faster datastructures are used.
		instead of regular map, unordered_map is used where applicable
	- Colors used with drawalpha can now differ from colors used without drawalpha.
		Colors.txt can now have 'duplicate' entries for nodes, depending on whether alpha
		transparency is on or off.
		With 'drawalpha', a non-opaque color entry (with alpha less than 255) is
		preferred, whereas without 'drawalpha', a color entry with alpha 255
		(or unspecified alpha) is preferred.
		In all other cases, later entries override former entries in the colors file.
		The color of water with drawalpha was changed a little.
	- The sqlite3 backend is now optional and can be disabled during compilation.
	- Failures parsing or decompressing the block data from the database are now caught and reported.
		Map generation continues, and aborts only after 100 or more errors.
		The error messages for decompression failures were also improved.
	- Geometry can now also be specified using 2 corners of the area (instead of corner and dimensions)
	- The configuration of tiles location was improved

    Bugfixes:
	- When not using a geometry option, *do* generate the smallest possible map
	- Fix transparency computation - libgd uses 0..127 (not 255)
	- Using an invalid option name no longer causes a crash, but is reported.
	- Fixed a crash when the top part of the generated map is empty
	- The computation of map size with tiles was fixed (height could be miscomputed)

[16 apr 2014]
    General: integrated all (relevant) patches from the minetest/minetestmapper tree
	(only patches that actually conflict with my work were obviously not merged)

    Features:
	- A grid can now be added to the map ( with '--tiles')
		Gridlines are drawn 'between' map rows/columns, and therefore do
		not obscure map data. (as a consequence, straight lines may not look
		straight where they cross gridlines).
	- Alpha transparency was added (merged from minetest/minetestmapper)
		Some improvements and fixes were added to make it work as expected
	- An option was added to print progress information during map generation
		This prints the z-coordinate of every block-row being rendered.
	- The map geometry can now be specified with node-granularity
		The geometry is no longer always rounded away from zero, to a multiple of 16.
		I.e. requesting a 80x82 map will result in a 80x82 map, not a 80x96 map
		(or even 96x112).
		The old behavior (i.e. block-granularity) is still available as well.
	- The colors.txt file is now searched for in different locations
		The mapper looks in the world directory for a colors.txt file by default
		Alternatively, the colors.txt file in $HOME/.minetest is used if it exists.
		A colors.txt file in the current directory is a last resort case, and causes a
		warning message.

    Enhancements:
	- Colors.txt is no longer included in the executable (merged from minetest/minetestmapper)
	- Option and colors parsing failures are handled more gracefully

    Bugfixes:
	- The computation of origin location and player locations was fixed (off-by-one)
	- Colors.txt is now parsed line-by-line, and errors are reported.
		Errors no longer cause the remainder of the file to be silently ignored.
	- A failure to create the image for lack of memory is now caught.
		When a lack of memory is to be expected during image generation, a warning is printed
		before image generation starts.
	- The handling of an alpha component in colors was fixed

[26 mar 2014]

    Features:
	- A map of the *requested* size can now be generated (after rounding to blocks)
		The option --forcegeometry makes sure the map is not reduced in size if the
		world is smaller than the requested geometry.
		Rounding to a multiple of the block size (i.e. 16) still happens.

    Enhancements:
	- The size of the map is not limited by default
		By default, only part of the world was included in the map
	- Performance was significantly improved
	- An ability to report the sizes of the world and of the map was added

    Bugfixes:
	- Fix geometry so that w and h are the map dimensions
	- Vertical limits handling (--min-y and --max-y) was fixed, and now works as expected
	- Failure to open the output file is now caught and handled gracefully
	- The computation of block number bounds was fixed (off-by-one)
