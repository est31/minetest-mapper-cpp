Features (short list)
=====================

Map Generation
--------------

* Support for both minetest and freeminer worlds
* Support for sqlite3, leveldb and redis map databases
* Generate a subsection of the map, or a full map
  (but note that the size of generated images is limited)
* Generate regular maps or height-maps
* All colors for regular or height maps are configurable
* Draw player positions
* Draw different geometric figures, or text on the map
* Draw the map at a reduced scale. E.g. 1:4.
* Draw a scale on the left and/or top side of the map,
  and/or a height scale (for height maps) on the bottom.
* Optionally draw some nodes transparently (e.g. water)
* User Manual

Building
--------
* Supports both the gcc and clang compiler suites
* Build windows, rpm, deb and/or tar.gz installation
  packages. Or simply type 'make install'.

Quick Start
===========

After installation, minetestmapper is started as follows:

('\\' is a continuation character - the command-line continues
on the next line. Type return only after the line that does
not end with the continuation character)


::

    minetestmapper \
	--input <world-directory> \
	--output <image-file-name.png>

If the world is not too large, and if minetestmapper is installed in
a  system directory, it will most likely work as expected.

Possibly, minetestmapper will not be able to find a colors.txt file. If that happens,
the colors.txt file can be specified on the command-line:

::

    minetestmapper \
	--input <world-directory> \
	--output <image-file-name.png> \
	--colors <filename>

Or the colors.txt file must be installed in a location where minetestmapper will find it.
A colors.txt file (named ``colors.txt``, in lowercase) in the world's directory will certainly
be found. Depending on the system and the configuration, other locations are available. Use the
following command to find out which:

::

    minetestmapper \
	--input <world-directory> \
	--output <image-file-name.png> \
	--verbose-search-colors=2
